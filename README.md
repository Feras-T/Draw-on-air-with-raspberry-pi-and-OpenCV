# Draw on Air (Raspberry Pi + OpenCV)

## Overview

Draw on the screen by moving your hand/finger in the air, using a Raspberry Pi + PiCamera and Python with OpenCV.  
A live camera window will appear, and after selecting your fingertip with the mouse, the program tracks it so you can “draw in the air”.

## Requirements

- **Raspberry Pi**
- **PiCamera** (or compatible camera)
- **Python**
- **OpenCV (cv2)**

## How to Use

1. **Adjust the camera** so your hand/finger is clearly visible in the frame.
2. **Copy `code.py`** to your Raspberry Pi.
3. **Run the script**:
   ```bash
   python3 code.py
4. Place the mouse pointer on the edge/tip of your finger, then press left click.  
   After that, move your finger and you can draw in the air.
